# The Vanilla HTML Email Framework
Email frameworks like Foundation and MJML require learning a new quasi-language and can produce a lot of bloat. This framework uses only vanilla HTML/CSS, accounts for all cross-client quirks, and creates an easy, modular foundation to build emails on.

[the css](CSS-Resets.css)

## HTML
Each module is a \<tr> wrapped in beginning and ending comments.
Within each \<tr> is a \<td>, then the content. Usually the content is wrapped by a \<table>. 
Anything inside the \<td> will not expand past the template. No max-width declarations are necessary.
All styles should be in CSS,
width="100%" cellpadding/spacing/border on \<table> is an exception.
height and width on resized (but only resized!) \<img>s is an exception.
The template is currently compliant with this rule except for a few align="" attributes that need to be replaced with a text-align: ; on the \<td>.

### Usage

* **Module Groups** define types of modules
  * Should be placed on the \<tr> wrapping the module
  * All modules are "primary" if they don't have a group assigned.
* **Module Names** identify the module
  * Should be placed on the \<tr> wrapping the module
  * The specific module names listed are reserved. They have styles baked into the core css boilerplate.
* **Module Modifiers** combine with other classes to address specific cases
  * Can be placed on any element
* **Module Parts** define pieces of the modules
  * Should be placed on the smallest \<td> practicable, and always td's to ensure outlook compatibility
  * .container is an exception, should be placed on largest \<td>
  * Simply not defining a module part with one of these classes is preferable to defining it & using css to undo the default module part styles
* **Responsive Designators** identify elements to show/hide on mobile
  * Can be placed on any element
  * These classes need additional code to actually show/hide. See snippets section.

Example usage:
```html
<tr id="module-name" class="secondary">
  <td class="background">
  
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td class="title">
          All work and no play
        </td>
        <td class="image">
          <img src="" class="mobile">
          <img src="" class="desktop">
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="content big">
          All work and no play makes Jack a sad boy.
        </td>
        <td class="content">
          All work and no play makes Jack a sad boy.All work and no play makes Jack a sad boy.All work and no play makes Jack a sad boy.All work and no play makes Jack a sad boy.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    
  </td>
</tr>
```
and the CSS:
```css
.secondary {
/* these styles affect all the secondary modules */
}

.secondary .content {
/* makes the content in secondary modules different */
}

#module-name .content.big {
/* styles elements designated "content" and "big" within the #module. While you could technically just use .content.big, adding the module name allows us to find the related html easier and eliminates conflicts with other modules that might have a "big" class. */
}
```

**NOTE:** The template contains 3 \<style> blocks, each for different purposes. If the above example was real, the "#module-name .content.big" selector would be in a different \<style> block. Read the comments in the template's \<style> blocks for more info.

**NOTE:** The default font-family and email width must be set seperately for outlook, using the conditional code found after the 1st style block and inside the body tags, respectively.
